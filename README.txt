The MLB all star voting was an opportunity I foresaw to get some good practice in for my automation skills.
I want to emphasize all runs of these test scripts during development were within my daily voting limits and did not break any rules of the terms & conditions.

In the event that the site is no longer up and you are referencing this project, please find the recorded videos of the scripts running at various stages in development.
